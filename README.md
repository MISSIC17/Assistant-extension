# Assistant-extension

```
This extension/add-on allows you to keep you up-to-date 
with your to-dos and lets you store the important notes
you would want to have
```

You can switch between the to-dos and notes keeper by clicking 
the **arrow buttons** on the top of the extension or simply use the 
keyboard **left** and **right** arrow to navigate between them.

## To-do-list

## Notes-keeper
* It has the same functionality as to-do-list except you can't delete all notes 
at the same time
* After writing the notes you can press **insert** from your keyboard to store it
