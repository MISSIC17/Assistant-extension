This extension/add-on allows you to keep you up-to-date 
with your to-dos and lets you store the important notes
you would want to have

You can switch between the to-dos and notes keeper by clicking 
the **arrow buttons** on the top of the extension or simply use the 
keyboard **left** and **right** arrow to navigate between them.

at the same time
*After writing the notes you can press **insert** from your keyboard to store it
